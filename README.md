# Python GUI Image Segmentor

This repository contains the code and sample image files, for my project on Image Segmentation and Bounding Box creation using Deep Learning Model, Mask R-CNN  

### Run the 'ImageViewerGUI.py' file via terminal or a code editor
  
The GUI window will open and you can select any image from your computer, via the "Select a file" option  
After that the Top 3 Segmentaion masks of the image will be created and pasted on top of the image  
You can switch between the segmentation masks and the bounding boxes, via the dropdown menu, and clicking on "Process"  
You can select new images in the same window, and click on "Process" to process the images
